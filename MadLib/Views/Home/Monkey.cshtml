      <p>The day I saw the Monkey King @Model.Verb was one of the most
        interesting days of the year.
        After he did that, the king played chess on his brother's
        @Model.Noun and then combed his @Model.Adjective hair with a
        comb made out of old fish bones. Later that same day, I saw the
        Monkey King dance in front of an audience of kangaroos and a @Model.Animal.</p>
